# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Jolee Liu**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **badminton**.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **flexbox** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Regarding **systems**, my website can help sport systems improve and make badminton specifically more widely accesible. Especially with my future softer birdie invention, maybe younger or disadvantaged players will feel safer playing with them.
* Regarding the **individual**, the ideas on my website can help badminton players feel more confident with having a reliable app to stay on track with their tournaments or find it more comfortable to play with a softer birdie.
* Regarding **relationships**, there's better sportsmanship between badminton players because they feel more connected when they are using the same advanced badminton technology.
* Regarding **jobs**, the software apps on my website and hawk-eye hardware can help tournament referees manage over a badminton tournament better (with the apps) and use the hardware to determine fairness.


##### CONS
* Regarading the **government**/**laws**, my future invention of a multi-headed racket or softer birdie may bring conflicts or disruption when it comes to the laws/rules of the badminton court.
* Regarding the **environment**, some of my future inventions may use double the resources or materials, using up more of the resources I need available.
