| Damaris  | I like how everything is very neat and organized as well as the formatting  | Try adding in some fonts and colors to make it look more appealing
| Darren Li  | I like how everything is  neat and how the text changeks the space it takes up when the screen changes size. | Some of the text is very hard to see because it blends in with the background like in the software and future technology sections, you should change the text to a color that sticks out more from the background so it is easier to see.
| Tina  | I like the images that you included and how you organized your website  |I would consider making the text within the black background a different color as the text is not exactly the most clear. 
| Jintian  | I like how responsive your website is, and the images representing the topic you are saying.  | I think the text color in black should be changed to white as it is not really clear for people to see.
