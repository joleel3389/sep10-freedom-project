# Presentation Plan

## Hook
<!-- ideas
* reflect on my experience with badminton being an easy sport to pick up?
* ask whether badminton is audience's favorite sport? -->
* tell a fun-fact about badminton?
  * did you know badminton is the fastest racket sport in the world?

## Product
* https://joleel3389.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/
  * show interactiveness and responsiveness

## Process
* How I made my wireframe
  * considerate of my fp tool (where to put it)
  * considerate of space on mobile devices
* how i tracked my flexbox learning
  * tracking on my learning log despite it not being mandatory anymore just to have notes on my tool
* challenges
  * fixing the responsiveness for context img
    * code snippets
  * dark background text not being light/readable enough
    * code snippets

## Conclusion
* Takeaways
  * you always need to be considerate of your users when making a website, so make sure to always take in feedback to ensure your website is user friendly or pleasing for users to look at. at first, my description text for dark backgrounds was a grey hard to see, but with peer feedback i changed it to be lighter and easier to see
  * for the most effective website reponsiveness, add more media queries. my context image's original ratio did not suit well for each breakpoint, so for the most aesthetically pleasing website i fixed this b having more specific media quieres (for more specific breakpoints) to make my website look more smooth responsive wise.
  * even if you aren't assigned to do something, you should be willing to do things that will benefit you. i was assigned a learning log at first for an entry once a week, but i felt it helpful to continue to use it daily until i tracked down everything i learned about my tool so i could look back on it later. i wasn't required to do this, but i did it anyway to help myself.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
