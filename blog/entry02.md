### Researching about badminton

---

For this entry, I was required to research about the software and hardware aspects of badminton. Some websites I found regarding badminton software were [Badminton4u](https://bwfbadminton.com/badminton4u/) for instance, which was a website about a badminton app available on Apple and Google play stores that would allow users to track tournaments on a calendar, get the latest live scores, and watch badminton videos in one place. There were also many other websites regarding badminton software, like [Sports carnival](https://sportscarnival.com/sports/badminton-software), being used to schedule courts, and for other booking details. When it comes to badminton hardware, I found websites like [Badminton bay](https://www.badmintonbay.com/yonex-racket-technology.html?srsltid=AfmBOopgYadYPVKRLaXbbQefD034KIWWS7uNyV6hR-zf0d3CUS_u33_l), that discusses the advanced tecnology Yonex badminton rackets use, such as a rotational generator system, NAMD, nanometrics, and more. [Badminton warehouse](https://www.badmintonwarehouse.com/blogs/news/what-is-namd-technology#:~:text=It%20stands%20for%20%22Nano-Advanced%20Material%20Development%22%20and%20is,with%20increased%20power%20and%20speed%20on%20their%20shots) was another website that talked about the NAMD (also known as nano-advanced material development) technology developed by Yonex. 
I didn't have trouble searching for the best results when searching about badminton software, but I did have to make some changes to my key words in my searches when searching abot badminton hardware.
