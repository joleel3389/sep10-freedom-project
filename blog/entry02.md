### Researching about badminton

---

For this entry, I was required to research about the software and hardware aspects of badminton. Some websites I found regarding badminton software were [Badminton4u](https://bwfbadminton.com/badminton4u/) for instance, which was a website about a badminton app available on Apple and Google play stores that would allow users to track tournaments on a calendar, get the latest live scores, and watch badminton videos in one place. There were also many other websites regarding badminton software, like [Sportscarnival](https://sportscarnival.com/sports/badminton-software), being used to schedule courts, and for other booking details.
