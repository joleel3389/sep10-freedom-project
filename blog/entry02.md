### Researching about badminton

---

For this entry, I was required to research about the software and hardware aspects of badminton. Some websites I found regarding badminton software were [Badminton4u](https://bwfbadminton.com/badminton4u/) for instance, which was a website about a badminton app available on Apple and Google play stores that would allow users to track tournaments on a calendar, get the latest live scores, and watch badminton videos in one place. There were also many other websites regarding badminton software, like [Sports carnival](https://sportscarnival.com/sports/badminton-software), being used to schedule courts, and for other booking details. When it comes to badminton hardware, I found websites like [Badminton bay](https://www.badmintonbay.com/yonex-racket-technology.html?srsltid=AfmBOopgYadYPVKRLaXbbQefD034KIWWS7uNyV6hR-zf0d3CUS_u33_l), that discusses the advanced tecnology Yonex badminton rackets use, such as a rotational generator system, NAMD, nanometrics, and more. [Badminton warehouse](https://www.badmintonwarehouse.com/blogs/news/what-is-namd-technology#:~:text=It%20stands%20for%20%22Nano-Advanced%20Material%20Development%22%20and%20is,with%20increased%20power%20and%20speed%20on%20their%20shots) was another website that talked about the NAMD (also known as nano-advanced material development) technology developed by Yonex. I didn't have much trouble searching for the best results when searching about badminton software, but I did have to make some changes to my key words in my searches when searching abot badminton hardware. For example, when searching about badminton software, searching a simple "badminton software" gave me access to a lot of informational sites, but when I searched "badminton hardware", I didn't get many informational sites and I had to change my search to "badminton hardware technology" for my search to be more effective. 

### Engineering Design Process

---

I'm now in the second stage of the engineering design process, which is to research the problem. I've reasearched about how technology is applied to badminton. Next is stage three, where I will try to brainstorm possible solutions to build my final website plan for the end of this freedom project. I hope to be able to decide on a solid website blueprint so that I can effectively inform others about my topic by the end of the year. 

### Skills

---

Here are the following skills I've learned while writing my second blog.

* **How to google**
  * As I'm in the second stage of the engineering design process, I needed to do a lot of research for my project. I encountered problems where my search wasn't able to find websites that were informational and helpful, so I had to change my searches a couple of times. For instance like the example I stated earlier, searching "badminton hardware" didn't really get me anywhere good, so when I changed up my search to "badminton hardware technology", I was able to see more informative websites about badminton hardware. 

* **Organization** 
  * With my research, I needed a way to organize the information I found on badminton, and so I put it all in my SEP10 notes for our freedom project unit. I was able to effectively organize the websites I found into bullet points, and then I put brief information about these websites in indented bullet points. I separated the badminton software websites from the badminton hardware websites and instead of putting all of my research about badminton software and hardware into a big block of text, I made it easier to read and locate. 

### Next steps

After researching about my topic, I'm excited to brainstorm possible solutions to my problem.
