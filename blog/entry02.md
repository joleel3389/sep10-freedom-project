### Researching about badminton

---

For this entry, I was required to research the software and hardware aspects of badminton. Some websites I found regarding badminton software were Badminton4u for instance, which was a website about a badminton app available on Apple and Google Play stores that would allow users to track tournaments on a calendar, get the latest live scores, and watch badminton videos in one place. There were also many other websites regarding badminton software, like Sports Carnival, being used to schedule courts, and for other booking details. When it comes to badminton hardware, I found websites like Badminton Bay, that discuss the advanced technology Yonex badminton rackets use, such as a rotational generator system, NAMD, nanometrics, and more. Badminton Warehouse was another website that talked about the NAMD (also known as nano-advanced material development) technology developed by Yonex. I didn't have much trouble searching for the best results when searching about badminton software, but I did have to make some changes to my keywords when searching about badminton hardware. For example, when searching for badminton software, searching a simple "badminton software" gave me access to a lot of informational sites, but when I searched "badminton hardware", I didn't get many informational sites and I had to change my search to "badminton hardware technology" for my search to be more effective.

### Engineering Design Process

---

I'm now in the second stage of the engineering design process, which is to research the problem. I've researched about how technology is applied to badminton. Next is stage three, where I will try to brainstorm possible solutions to build my final website plan for the end of this freedom project. I hope to be able to decide on a solid website blueprint so that I can effectively inform others about my topic by the end of the year.

### Skills

---

Here are the following skills I've learned while writing my second blog.

* **How to google**
  * As I'm currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, I needed to do a lot of research for my project. I encountered problems where my search couldn't find websites that were informational and helpful, so I had to change my searches a couple of times. For instance, like the example I stated earlier, searching "badminton hardware" didn't really get me anywhere good, so when I changed up my search to "badminton hardware technology", I was able to see more informative websites about badminton hardware.

* **Organization** 
  * With my research, I needed a way to organize the information I found on badminton, so I put it all in my SEP10 notes for our freedom project unit. I was able to effectively organize the websites I found into bullet points, and then I put brief information about these websites in indented bullet points. I separated the badminton software websites from the badminton hardware websites and instead of putting all of my research about badminton software and hardware into a big block of text, I made it easier to read and locate.

### Next steps

After researching my topic of badminton, I'm excited to brainstorm possible solutions to my problem.
