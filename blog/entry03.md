# Entry 3: New ideas for my topic (Badminton)
##### 12/18/24

### Brainstorming new technological ideas for my topic

---

For entry 3, I was required to now brainstorm new technological ideas for my topic following the information I gathered on already existing technologies. 

### Engineering design process 

---

I'm now in the third stage of the EDP (Engineering design process), which is to brainstorm possible solutions. After researching how technology applies to badminton, I've been trying to brainstorm possible new innovations and technologies that could be a benefit to badminton. For the next stage of EDP which is stage four; to plan the possible solution, I plan to finalize my solution for my prototype. I hope that my solution is promising and innovative enough. 

### Skills

---

Here are the following skills I've learned while writing my third blog. 

- **Creativity**
  - Since my third entry is about brainstorming ideas, I've tried to be very creative with my ideas so that they are both logical and useful. In order to create new ideas, I need creativity as a skill, which I gained when working on the third entry of my freedom project. Before, I didn't see myself as very creative but as I brainstormed ideas for badminton, I started to think outside the box and think of good ideas that don't exist yet that could be utilized in badminton.
  
- **Consideration**
  - My ideas could be supposedly used by other people if they find a use for it, so I needed to make sure that my ideas could actually be taken into consideration, rather than disgregarded for being useless. I considered the consumers and how my new ideas would come to use for my project.
  
### Next steps

---

After brainstorming possible ideas for badminton, I'm ready to move onto the next EDP stage- to plan a promising final solution.
