# Entry 3: New ideas for my topic (Badminton)

### Brainstorming new technological ideas for my topic

---

For entry 3, I was required to now brainstorm new technological ideas for my topic following the information I gathered on already existing technologies. Since they had to be new ideas, I didn't use any websites- but for sources I looked at previous student's  freedom projects. Some of their websites I looked at was one about [oceanography](https://austinl1905.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) and one about [music](https://jairop2409.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/). My topic is badminton which is pretty specific in my opinion, so I did not see any previous projects with the same topic for reference. Instead, I just generally looked at the future innovations section and how it was organized/formatted so I could use it as inspiration on how to format my new technological ideas for badminton. For my new ideas, I considered ideas like a birdie made out of a different material, a birdie that's customized, or a racket with multiple heads on it. These ideas can be helpful if someone would like a safer birdie tip for their kids to play without getting hurt or if people want to challenge themselves and have more fun when playing. I had to consider the consumers and be more creative so that my ideas would be adequate enough. 

### Engineering design process 

---

I'm now in the third stage of the EDP (Engineering design process), which is to brainstorm possible solutions. After researching how technology applies to badminton, I've been trying to brainstorm possible new innovations and technologies that could be a benefit to badminton. For the next stage of EDP which is stage four; to plan the possible solution, I plan to finalize my solution for my prototype. I hope that my solution is promising and innovative enough. 

### Skills

---

Here are the following skills I've learned while writing my third blog. 

- **Creativity**
  - Since my third entry is about brainstorming ideas, I've tried to be very creative with my ideas so that they are both logical and useful. In order to create new ideas, I need creativity as a skill, which I gained when working on the third entry of my freedom project. Before, I didn't see myself as very creative but as I brainstormed ideas for badminton, I started to think outside the box and think of good ideas that don't exist yet that could be utilized in badminton.
  
- **Consideration**
  - My ideas could be supposedly used by other people if they find a use for it, so I needed to make sure that my ideas could actually be taken into consideration, rather than disgregarded for being useless. I considered the consumers and how my new ideas would come to use before planning to put it on the context of my project. 
  
### Next steps

After brainstorming possible ideas for badminton, I'm ready to move onto the next EDP stage- to plan a promising final solution.
