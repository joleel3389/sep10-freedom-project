### Reflection of my FP presentation & pitch

---

For entry 7, I was required to present and give an elevator pitch on my freedom project. For my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PIbubrEI-GwVji8e2RpyZza8Tsej7s4sW-0vGIsyrMA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.atgmf9145it0) what I took away was that my elevator pitch must've not been clear enough. I think that although I felt more confident in public speaking when I was giving my pitch and presentation, I should strive to be louder when I am public speaking and also make my ideas clearer. I feel that the purpose of my website wasn't very clear in my elevator pitch, which may have made it unappealing. I also felt that I struggled a little bit to answer any questions asked of me briefly and within an efficient time. Meanwhile, for my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wMPFz90grDGXiIwFuvdEfSWCYMPqH4OSHJH-f29aHwc/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p), I was more proud of how I handled my presentation. However, I still faced the same problem of how I was not loud enough. Even though I believe that I'm loud enough, sometimes others miss out on the information I have to say. On the bright side, I believe I organized what I wanted to say very well, and elaborated a lot about what was on my slides (in order to keep the text minimal). I was able to get all the good ideas I wanted to say out, but my delivery still definitely needs to be worked on in terms of my loudness. Being loud can also correlate with my ideas not being clearly presented, so I would need to work on clearly presenting my great ideas. Therefore my main takeaways from my elevator pitch and presentation were to generally speak way louder, make my ideas clearer, make my pitch more appealing, and to respond quicker and confidently to show my understanding of my topic.

### EDP

---

I'm on the 6th stage of the engineering design process which is to test and evaluate. My website is functioning well, so I got it evaluated by my teacher and upperclassmen through a presentation and elevator pitch. After finishing stage 6, I will move on to stage 7 which is to improve as needed. Additionally, I will also move on to stage 8 which is to communicate the results. After receiving feedback from my presentation, I will work on speaking louder for better public speaking skills, and to do this I will continue to communicate results/present to others. I hope to be naturally better at presenting in the future.

### Skills

---

These are the following skills I've learned from writing my 7th blog.

* Communication
    * When giving my presentations, I've realized that I'm not as loud enough as I think I am. I'm not a strong public speaker, so when getting advice back after giving out my presentation, I was able to recognize the flaws I had. However, I got over my fear of public speaking and felt more confident than I used to when giving my presentation. My voice may not be loud enough, but I improved my public speaking in regard to my shyness. I feel less shy when giving presentations and know what I want to say.
* Organization
    * When making my presentation and making a draft of my elevator pitch, I tried to organize my ideas and what I wanted to say so it wouldn't turn out messy. I first introduced my topic/what my website was about, then my process, my takeaways, and then concluded. I ensured that when I presented, my ideas were not all over the place.

### Next steps

---

For my next steps, I want to move to step 7 and 8 which is to improve as needed and communicate results. I will improve my public speaking skills from now on.
