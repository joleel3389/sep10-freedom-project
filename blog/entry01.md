### How I came to choose badminton
 
---

For my project, the topic I ultimately chose was **badminton** since it's a sport that I can play pretty decently and enjoy. I'm not that good at other sports or athletic activities, but badminton is very enjoyable for me. Before settling on badminton, I was debating between music and food as well. However, I thought badminton would be a more exciting topic to do a project about, and learn more about the sport I like. Websites like [How Technology Is Transforming The Food Industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolemartin1/2019/04/29/how-technology-is-transforming-the-food-industry/) by Forbes and [The Impact of Technology on Music: A Deep Dive](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/entertainment/the-impact-of-technology-on-music-a-deep-dive) by Yellowbrick did pique my interest a little, while [What is NAMD technology?](https://www.badmintonwarehouse.com/blogs/news/what-is-namd-technology#:~:text=NAMD%20technology%20is%20a%20proprietary,construction%20of%20badminton%20racket%20frames) by Badminton Warehouse pulled me deeper into the topic of badminton. Thus, I chose to research badminton as my topic.

### Engineering Design Process

I'm currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, defining the problem. The problem that I'm trying to address is how technology is applied in badminton. I hope to be able to address what technologies are used in badminton, to eventually end my project with a well-informed project about how we can connect technology to badminton.
