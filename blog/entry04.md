### Picking a tool to use for my freedom project

---

For entry 4, my task was to choose a tool to use on my freedom project. The tool I ended up choosing is flexbox, because I've tinkered with it prior to choosing my freedom project tool, and I found it useful for making a website look more visually appealing to my taste with the way how contained elements could be arranged in a box layout. Documentations I used to guide me while tinkering were [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) and [css tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Before, it felt like all of my elements could only be aligned vertically on top of one another with my limited CSS knowledge, but with flexbox- I tinkered with it so that I could have two elements on a row next to each other, positioned to be evenly spaced, and with the default no wrapping. The following code snippet shows an example of how I experimented with flexbox properties like `flex-direction` and `justify-content`.

```CSS
.buttons {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    row-gap: 0px;
    gap: 0px;
    margin: auto;
    width: 80%;
    padding-top: 7px;
}
```

While the following image below shows the output of my CSS code.

### Engineering design process

---

I'm in the 4th stage of the EDP (engineering design process), which is to plan the most promising solution. After brainstorming possible ideas for badminton, I've been looking into possible freedom project tools that I can use for my freedom project, to which I chose flexbox. My next step of EDP is to create a prototype, where I will most likely create the base website for my freedom project.

### Skills

---

Here are the following skills I've learned while writing my fourth blog.

- **How to learn**
    - Prior to choosing what freedom project tool to learn about (flexbox), I practiced and learned flexbox when trying to make the CSS of one of my projects more appealing to look at. Usually I don't try to learn something on my own and usually learn with either guidance or when assigned, but I was able to take the initiative to learn something new on my own this time around.
- **How to read**
    - When trying to learn about my freedom project tool (flexbox), I needed to read a few documentations to learn about it, like on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for instance. I tinkered while following the documentation so that I could fully understand the concepts of what property does what (such as "`justify-content`") and how it works when coded.

### Next steps

---

After choosing my freedom project tool, I will move on to step 5 of the EDP- to create a prototype.
