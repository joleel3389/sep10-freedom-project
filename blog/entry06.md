### Making my MVP for my freedom project

---

For entry 6, my task was to write about how I made my MVP of my freedom project, including takeaways and challenges. For my MVP, my goal was to include all of my context, part a information, part b information, my timeline, my wireframe, incorporate flexbox (FP tool), making my wesbite responsive, having unique fonts, and having a unique color scheme. For all of my actual content, I researched before hand in the first 3 steps, so it was ready to be copied and pasted. To incorporate my FP tool which was flexbox, I looked back on notes from my learning log, which I was able to make with the help of [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp). For my wireframe, fonts, and colors, I used resources from the HSTAT SEP student page to help me choose what I wanted. Regarding the actual coding including responsiveness and bootstrap components, I reviewed bootstrap components I was going to use again on [GetBootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/). However, when doing the MVP of my freedom project, I've come across takeaways and challenges.

For instance, one thing I took away from this project was that for your website to have the best responsiveness on all screen sizes, you may need more than one media query. For the image in my badminton context seen below, I used to only have a media query for screens under 1200px, but I discovered the same ratio I set for screens under 1200px in width didn't look very nice or appealing. And so, I created another media query for 992px wide (lg) and 768px wide (md).

Another takeway I had was that I need to be considerate of my users. Initially, my description text for my dark background sections was too light for the user to be able to read. With feedback, I've changed this description text font color to be lighter than it used to be, making it easier for people to read when they look at my website like shown.

### EDP

I'm on the 5th stage on the engineering design process, which is to create a prototype. With my MVP done, the minimum viable product of my prototype (freedom project) is done. After finishing step 5, I plan to move onto step 6 and evaluate my prototype. I'm going to test my freedom project to see that it's functioning well and is proven to be effective. I'm also going to work towards a possible beyond MVP list of things I could do to further improve my freedom project for the most effectiveness.

### Skills

---

These are the following skills I've learned from writing my 6th blog.
* Consideration
    * When coding my freedom project, I had to consider the user who would be viewing my website. Initially, I put description text on my dark bacgrounds a shade of grey, but with feedback from my peers I discovered that the shade of grey I chose was very hard to read. Especially on a dark background, it was hard to distinguish the grey text from the dark background. And so, I listened to this feedback from my peers and changed the description text color to be lighter, making it easier to read while being presented on a dark background.
* Organization
    * While planning for my freedom project, I've discovered the effectiveness of having a wireframe before you code. Usually, when it comes to planning beforehand, I don't like making a plan and I go straight into making something. However, with wireframes I've discovered that it's different and actually very useful to have a wireframe before you start coding. It's hard to visualize how you want your website to look like in particular unless you have a wireframe.

### Next steps

After creating my prototype for step 5, I plan to move onto step 6, which is to test and evaluate the prototype.
