# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Flexbox**

---

### 3/6/25:
* I learned how to use the `justify-content` property.
    * Variables I can use with this property are `center`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `space-around`, `space-between`, and `space-evenly`.
        * I used the value `space-evenly`, so my elements under my **buttons** class would be equidistant from each other.
* I learned how to use the `flex-direction` property.
    * Variables used with this property are `row`, `column`, `row-reverse`, and `column-reverse`.
        * I used the `row` value to have my elements displayed horizontally, but not in reversed order.

This is my CSS that shows my tinkering. 
```
.buttons {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    margin: auto;
    width: 80%;
    padding-top: 7px;
}
```
